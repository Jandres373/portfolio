      <p>I'm a passionate anthropologist and web developer based in Colombia.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What's my current goal? Adding a neuro-cultural twist to development, ensuring digital solutions are not just
        techy but also human-friendly and adaptable.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        And what's on the horizon? I'm deeply immersed in unraveling the intricacies of the human mind while
        simultaneously riding the waves of Machine Learning on the flip side. This fuels my mission to seamlessly merge
        AI with Anthropology and bio-cultural approaches in the digital solutions I aim to craft.
